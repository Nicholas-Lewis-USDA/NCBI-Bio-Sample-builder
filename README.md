# NCBI-Bio-Sample-builder
Pulls Data from NCBI based on Sample name or SRR #

Allows a user to supply sample names and SRR #'s and will pull back from NCBI via Excel spreadsheet, the Sample Name, SRR#, Project#, Submitter and the website used to generate the information for manual verification

This was a pretty target build but I built most of the program so that it can be easily adapted to search and add other items on request or if others with to contribute.
